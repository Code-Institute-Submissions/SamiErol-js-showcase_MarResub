# Project Title

Sami Erol CV

### Description

A website developed to lay out my CV and to showcase my work learned throughout my course.

### UX Design & User Stories

The design for my project focused on being as simple and user friendly as possible. I did not want to confuse any users after they land on my site, the main use of the site will be to review my CV so it is important that nothing impedes or obstructs this. The site is optimized to accommodate a range of resolutions so mobile and desktop users will have the same experience.

Wireframes

- I designed the original wireframes on mockflow here: https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/Mf9264c9a799eca9ba0bb73aae8ff4a341617044774370#/page/557e422fb338434ab92cc3677347ffd1

User Stories

- As a user I want to browse the content of the page so I can understand the CV
- As a user I want a way to jump to section of the page so I can get there faster
- As a user I want a way to contact the CV owner so that I can leave a message
- As a user I want to browse a map so I can visualise locations lived
- As a user I want the ability to switch to dark mode and light mode for eye comfort

### Functionalities

Google Maps
- I have implemented this API in my project to allow users to see my hometown and current city on the map.

JavaScript examples
- Google Maps is the primary example, along with my contact form validation, dark mode and snap-to navigation features.

CV
- Clearly laid out CV, tested for desktop/mobile layouts. Sticky navigation helps to go between pages.

### Deployment

https://samierol.github.io/js-showcase/index.html

The project is deployed using GitHub Pages. This was chosen as it a simple method to host static websites.

No configuration was required as GitHub is where the project source code is hosted, it just had to be enabled. When updated code is pushed, the GitHub pages site is updated automatically.
